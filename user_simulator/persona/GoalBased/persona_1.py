RAW_REVIEW = """
I bought this car on eBay. I've had no problems other than putting tires on (it needed them when I bought it)
and changing the oil. Great fuel economy for such a big car. Highway I get ~24 and town is around 15.
It is very comfortable to drive and has the power needed when necassary. All in all I love the car (my 3rd Jag)
and can't imagine driving anything else.
