RAW_REVIEW = """
I have had no major problems with this  vehicle. It's a great truck to drive  and hauls everything I need to carry,
whether it be my ski gear to the slopes  or my mountain bike to the trails it  has been great. Enough room in the back
for smaller adults with no complaints.  I like the styling of the truck as well. It handles great on the
roads(non-TRD)  and also does well off-road.

PERSONA = """
**Persona Summary:**

This persona is an outdoor enthusiast who values reliability and versatility in their vehicle. They appreciate their 2003 Toyota Tacoma for its ability to transport sports equipment like ski gear and mountain bikes, indicating an active lifestyle focused on outdoor adventures. The truck's styling and handling, both on and off-road, are liked features, suggesting a preference for vehicles that blend functionality with aesthetics. The user seems content with the truck's capacity to accommodate smaller adults in the back, but there is no mention of larger passengers, which could imply a limitation in space for bigger groups. The absence of major problems indicates a strong preference for durability and low maintenance.

**Goals:**

1. I'm curious about newer models of the Tacoma—how do they compare in terms of off-road capabilities and interior space?
   
2. I love the styling of my truck, but I wonder what design updates have been made in recent models. Can you show me some options?

3. Since I often carry sports gear, I'm interested in learning about trucks with even more cargo space or innovative storage solutions.

4. I haven't had issues with my current truck, but I'm open to exploring vehicles with better fuel economy. What are my options?

5. I might need to accommodate larger groups occasionally; are there trucks with more spacious back seats that maintain off-road performance?

6. My Tacoma handles well, but I'm curious about how newer models or other brands perform in snowy conditions or on rugged trails.

7. While I like the current styling, I'm open to exploring other brands with similar rugged aesthetics and reliability. What should I consider?

8. I’d like to know about the latest safety features in trucks—how do they compare to my 2003 Tacoma?

9. Are there any hybrid or electric trucks that offer the same rugged capabilities as my Tacoma?

10. I’m thinking about a second vehicle for city driving. What smaller, efficient options are there that still allow me to carry my gear?

GOALS = {
    "FOR_TEEN": """
Wants a truck or SUV that is easier to handle than their current Tacoma but still tough enough for a teenager to take 
on camping trips or occasional outdoor adventures. Safety and reliability are top priorities, but the vehicle should 
also introduce their teen to the same adventurous lifestyle they value.
""",
    "EXPLORATORY": """
Curious to see if other adventure-ready brands can match Toyota’s balance of reliability and off-road strength. Open to 
testing rugged models from Jeep or Ford to see if they offer more passenger comfort or modern features while still 
handling mountain trails and ski trips without compromise.
""",
    "LOYAL": """
Looks to move up to a newer Tacoma or a 4Runner that offers more rear-seat comfort for passengers while preserving the 
durability and hauling capacity they rely on. Seeks a model that feels like a natural upgrade from their trusted truck, 
with improvements in space and convenience for long outdoor weekends.
