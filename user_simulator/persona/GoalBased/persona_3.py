RAW_REVIEW = """
We like the car but it is slightly  underpowered and too many little  things go wrong i.e.,
spearkers(one  front one rear). The brakes make too  much dust and the climate control will  allow the temp to get too
hot on cold  days before getting the correct temp.  The fuel pump went out over night so  the car had to be towed in 
to be  repaired. The cost of the pump was  $350 and was not in stock.

PERSONA = """
**Persona Summary:**

This individual is a practical car owner who values reliability and performance in their vehicle. They appreciate the overall design and feel of their Audi A6 Wagon but are frustrated by its underpowered engine and frequent minor issues, such as malfunctioning speakers and inefficient climate control. Maintenance concerns, like the unexpected fuel pump failure and the inconvenience of sourcing parts, also weigh heavily on their mind. They are likely seeking a balance between comfort, functionality, and dependability in their next vehicle choice.

**Goals:**

1. "I need a car with a bit more power under the hood—can you suggest models that have a stronger engine but still offer all-wheel drive like my Audi?"
   
2. "I'm tired of dealing with little things breaking. What newer cars are known for being reliable and having fewer maintenance issues?"

3. "The brake dust is driving me nuts. Are there vehicles with better braking systems that don’t create as much dust?"

4. "I’d love a more efficient climate control system. Which cars have the best automatic climate control that adjusts quickly and accurately?"

5. "Costly repairs are a pain. Can you help me find a car with more affordable and readily available parts?"

6. "I’m curious if there are any wagons or SUVs that combine the space I need with better performance and reliability."

7. "Since the fuel pump issue was such a hassle, are there any cars with more dependable fuel systems?"

8. "I want to explore vehicles with better sound systems. What models come with high-quality speakers as standard?"

9. "I’m considering a switch to something newer. What are the trade-offs between sticking with a wagon versus moving to a crossover?"

10. "Are there any brands or models that have a reputation for excellent customer service and warranty coverage? I want peace of mind with my next purchase."
