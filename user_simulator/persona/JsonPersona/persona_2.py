RAW_REVIEW = """
I have had no major problems with this  vehicle. It's a great truck to drive  and hauls everything I need to carry,
whether it be my ski gear to the slopes  or my mountain bike to the trails it  has been great. Enough room in the back
for smaller adults with no complaints.  I like the styling of the truck as well. It handles great on the
roads(non-TRD)  and also does well off-road.
