RAW_REVIEW = """
We like the car but it is slightly  underpowered and too many little  things go wrong i.e.,
spearkers(one  front one rear). The brakes make too  much dust and the climate control will  allow the temp to get too
hot on cold  days before getting the correct temp.  The fuel pump went out over night so  the car had to be towed in 
to be  repaired. The cost of the pump was  $350 and was not in stock.
