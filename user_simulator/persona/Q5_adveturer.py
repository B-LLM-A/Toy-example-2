RAW_REVIEW = """
Thus far, I’ve driven my Q5 55 TFSIe from Boston to LA, and all through
the mountains and desert of California. This vehicle absolutely tears the road up for me.
My favorite is when some idiot is tailgating me and swerving at 85mph, throwing his hands up,
I just move over and once he goes to fly past me in a fit of rage, I just blow him away for the fun of it.
The combined performance of the 2.0 turbo and electric is amazing; while the turbo spools,
the electric pushes me right through. 0-60 is great, but for me the 80-100+ is amazing.
The drive is extremely tight. Fingers crossed I haven’t had to deal with Audi/VW yet.
